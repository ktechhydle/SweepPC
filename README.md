# SweepPC
Keep your PC clean with a desktop app that manages it all for you!

## Overview
SweepPC provides a simple-to-use user interface allowing you to do things like:

* **Manage RAM** Delete all that memory bogging down your computer at the click of a button.

* **Clean temporary files** Get rid of garbage files generated by apps on your computer.

* **View the things you forgot about** Find duplicates and large old files that can optionally be deleted.
  
## Speed
SweepPC is implemented in Rust, which means it is **FAST** for file management tasks, deleting memory, and processing large amounts of data.

## The Plan
As of right now, SweepPC is still under active development. We plan to release all beta and alpha versions for free, but any stable releases will be available for a one-time payment of $20 on the official MP Software website. Our goal is too stay away from a SaaS approach (no subscription) and release SweepPC for a lifetime payment.
