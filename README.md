# SweepPC
Supervise your PC and keep it clean with a desktop app that does it for you😎

## Overview
SweepPC provides a simple user interface allowing you to do things like:

* **Manage Hardware 🖥️** Dive in on whats happening with your RAM/CPU/GPU.

* **Temporary Files 📂** Trash those garbage files generated by apps.

* **Deep Scan 🔎** View the things you forgot about, find duplicates and similarities, look for large files.

* **Malware Protection 👹** Hunt down those malicious processes hidden from you.
  
## Speed
SweepPC is implemented in Rust, which means it is **FAST** for file management tasks, deleting memory, and processing large amounts of data.

## The Plan
As of right now, SweepPC is still under active development. We plan to release all beta and alpha versions for free, but any stable releases will be available for a one-time payment of $20 on the official MP Software website. Our goal is too stay away from a SaaS approach (no subscription) and release SweepPC for a lifetime payment.
